# Predicting-Tasks-The-Sparks-Foundation

In this repo, you will find a notebook that contains 2 tasks from my virtual internship at **The Sparks Foundation**. The first is about predicting using supervised ML as I made a linear regression model to analyse the relation between students' hours of study and their scores then predict new values. The second one is about using unsupervised ML to cluster Iris data and also predict new values.
